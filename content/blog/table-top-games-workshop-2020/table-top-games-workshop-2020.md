# FDG2020 | 3rd Workshop on Tabletop Games
# September 15-18 | Malta


## Introduction
Analog games have seen a surge of interest, board game cafes, new titles, and a more accepting culture to role-playing games as a pass-time has fueled a boom in sales. 

However, academic research is relatively stagnating upon the analog domain as an object of design, due to both the interdisciplinary nature taking cues from computer science, narrative creation, psychology, and due to a lack of good publication venues for such works. 

Although being integrated to achieve severe and crucial outcomes such as brain health diagnosis, industrial training, recruitment process, analog games have been facing the lack of severe attempts for human factors consideration and design improvisation. 

The workshop endeavours to highlight such issues with the discussion upon existing solutions and potential areas of improvement. 

Furthermore, the aim of this workshop is to address the gap, looking at the ways in which academics can apply their tools to the discussion of analog games, including but not limited to board games, war games, and tabletop role-playing. New computer-based technologies such as player agents, 3D printing and rapid prototyping, crowd-funding, etc. will revolutionize the industry.
